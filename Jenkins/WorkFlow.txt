Continuos Integration Working Process:

1) Initially create a free style project named java_compile
2) Go to Source code management and pass the Git link URL
3) After that Go to Build Environment and Invoke Top level Maven targetby choosing the Maven Version
4) For choosing Maven version prior to that go to Dashboard -> ManageJenkins -> Global Tool Configuration here in Maven Add Maven and choose the version to 3.6.3
5) Then choose the Goals to be clean compile and save the project
6) After that Build the particular project
7) Similarly create another project named java_package and follow the same process as above then choose the goals to be package and then build the project
8) Here in this project go to workspace -> target there we see the .war file which basically contains code, applications and dependencies and can be deployed on any server
9) Create another project named java_deploy and follow the same steps as above
10) One addition step in build click on Add post build option and choose deploy war/ear to container by default this plugin is not available so need to install from Manage jenkins
11) And specify the war/ear files to be **/*.war and choose context path to be JavaHello
12) Next choose container to be Tomcat 9 and add the credentials and specify the path to be localohost:8081
13) Next go to localhost:8081/JavaHello which basically display the content as present in .jsp file
